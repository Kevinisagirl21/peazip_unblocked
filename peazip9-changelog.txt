It is possible to extract either one or more entire archive(s), or selected archive content while browsing archives
If right mouse button is pressed, it will be possible to choese to extract with or without new folder/smart new folder, overriding defaults
 It is now possible to use drag and drop to add items from file browser/archive browser to Bookmarks panel
Archives are now tested for encryption also for list/test operations, so password is required in advance if needed

Added Comment, and Info functions to Status bar context menu, to improve its usefulness in providing information to user
Improved direct extraction of archives from context menu
From context menu "Extract to" submenu it is now possible to directly extract all or selected item(s), without further confirmation, to any output path in bookmarks, history or breadcrumb
Extract here links (optionally to smart folder or to new folder) can now extract all or selected items
In the dropdown menu of Extract button are still available "Extract all" entries
Selection and navigation submenus in extraction and archiving screens are now organized in same way of extract here submenu: bookmarks are shown first, history, session history, and breadcrumb are shown in History submenu
Rename dialog now allows to directly switch to Move to dialog (change file path string rather than file name string)
Updated themes
New Mac and Tux themes
Old themes and additional custom themes are still available online, clicking "Check for Themes" button on Themes screen
(Windows 10+) The application, which by default follows system colors, can be manually forced to light or dark mode, regardless system mode, creating an empty file named "light" or "dark" in the same path of the executable (not integrated with themes due to technical limitations)

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Added new command line switches, which can be used both in scripts and for system integration (context menus, SendTo items, .desktop files, Automator scripts)
-ext2neutral directly extracts archives in current path applying the "new folder" policy as defined in PeaZip app (non, new folder, smart new folder, or force new folder)
-ext2downloads, -ext2desktop, -ext2documents directly extract archives in Downloads, Desktop, or Documents path (applying app's new folder policy)
-ext2bookmark(1..8) extract archives in the path of the bookmarked item number 1 to 8
Windows context menu versions of those switches begins with -ext2multi instead of -ext2
Created sample scripts (.bat, .sh), W11 mini-context menu entries, SendTo items, .desktop files and macOS service menus for -ext2downloads, -ext2desktop, -ext2documents switches, in (PeaZip)/res/share/batch directory

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Improved the scripting generation engine:
In Console tab af archiving and extraction screens it is now available a new option for the scripting engine to use strdin/stdout pipe for creation and extraction of compressed TAR archives, so no intermediate TAR file needs to be saved on disk during those operations
This option does not apply to the GUI app itself (which launches the operations as distinct single processes), but only to scripts generated by the application, which can be saved to run independently in console instances
The option applies only to formats handles through 7z / p7zip backend
For extraction operation, the option applies only a single or multiple archives are sent to extraction scren, not while brosing a single archive (either for partial or total extraction)

The option can be set for 7z / p7zip backend only, or for all backend binaries
The option can be hardcoded at compile time with HSYSBIN constant, 0 (default) means the value is not hardcoded and the option is read from configuration
The option does not apply to specific binaries which are meant to remain in app's own path: peazip binary itself, pea, PeaZip configuration wizard (Windows), and legacy binaries in unace and urar5 plugins
Improved batch command switches for archive creation
Added -add2arc, -add2sfxarc, and -add2rar switches (usable in batch scripts, context menus, .destop files, Automator scripts) to directly add items to ARC, self extracting ARC, and RAR archive (needs WinRar rar.exe or equivalent being available in the system)
Those switches can be used in .reg files in the add2multi* form
Removed legacy code for functions of -add2* and -add2separate* switch groups
Various fixes and improvements

FILE MANAGER
Adder quicker control to change ZIP filenames encoding
Codepage can be selected from a list in main menu Options > Text encoding, from file manager's context menu, and from archiving / extraction context menus

Comment can be manually edited or loaded from text file (selected from dialog or dragged on the form), and can be saved to text file for future use
Comment con contain UTF8 characters and are limited to 64 KB for all formats (RAR standard would allow 256KB comments but some Rar.exe versions does not support 64K+ comments), please note some other archive managers may not support UTF8 comments, or such large comments
RAR comments limitations
Writing comments to RAR archive requires Rar.exe or equivalent installed on the system, reading comments does not require Rar.exe
Cannot currently read comment from multi volume RAR archives, and from legacy RAR4 archives (but new comment can be written)
 ZIP/ZIPX comments limitations
Consistently with 7-Zip and WinRar, comments are not supported for spanned multi-volumes ZIP/ZIPX archives
 It is possible to set comment from command line scripts with following syntax:
 peazip -setcomment commentstring archive1..n
 peazip -setcommentf commentfile archive1..n

Syntax: peazip (-add2brotli -add2bzip2 -add2gzip -add2tar -add2wim -add2xz -add2zstd -add2zpaq) file1..n
If no input file or folder is provided after the switch, the archive creation screen remains open for input
The switches can be used in scripts, and for system integration (links, .desktop files, Automator scripts)
Same switches in -add2multi* form can be used to integration with Windows registry
