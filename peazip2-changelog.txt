To attack previos releases an attacker could build archives containing objects with nonvalid filenames, containing concatenated commands in the filename "hidden" to the user by making the filename very long with spaces to trick users in non reading the latter part of the name. If unaware users had downloaded such archive and doubleclicked or otherwise opened the archived file entry containing the concatenated command, would have put in execution the command (with current user rights). Fixes:
                      # check file/dir names for:
                            * non-allowed characters (0..31)

                + Added support for LZMA archives; currently supported formats: 71 extensions grouped in 43 families;

                      # New keyboard shortcuts (see documentation)
                + Archive creation:
                      # By default remember last used compression format

                + Archive extraction
                      # "extract selected to" using middle mouse button
                      # Extract / extract to / test toolbar buttons: new popup menu to apply the action to displayed or selected objects
