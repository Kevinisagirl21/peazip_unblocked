CODE
Can now optionally check hash of backend binaries called by PeaZip in order to detect modified ones, from main menu Tools > Verify hash of binaries.
Check is performed against known SHA256 (cryptographically strong) hashes of known backend binaries, embedded in peazip main binary at compile time in "checkchash" function in peach.pas
Can now optionally hardcode paths of backend binaries, configuration, and non-binary resources directories as absoulte paths at compile time as HBINPATH, HCONFPATH, and HSHAREPATH constants
This allow to optionally force those directories to be placed in system-specific paths in order to meet specific FHS or security requirements
Hardcoded paths must be written as absoulte paths ending with directory separator
If not hardcoded at compile time, those paths are by default (peazip)/res/bin, (peazip)/res/conf (or system dependent for installable packages), (peazip)/res/share respectively
Of course in both cases those directories can be replaced in packages by links to different paths, if it comes handy to enforce FHS rules
Re-organized source package to improve usability, and introducing more quick start examples for building peazip packages; sources are now in dev subfolder of the package.
Various fixes and improvements

FILE MANAGER
(macOS) Can now correctly recognize Movies directory in user's home
Added "Open in a new tab" to breadcrumb navigation menu
Can now export content of navigation/search filter as CSV, from column's header menu, and Main menu > Navigation submenu

Default column sizes of file browser are now aware of DPI scaling
Search bar in address bar can now be optionally kept expanded (width is remembered)
Theme screen reorganized to be easier to understand
Theme screen now allows to set more application's color presets; alongside dim and low light are now available Graphite, Plum, Mocha, and Senape applying a non-neutral color modifier to the UI
Embedded icons improved
Improved themes: updated Different, and Main themes, Gray theme replaced by Minimal theme.

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Can now remember default archive creation action (force new archive, add, update, sync...)
The option will anyway be temporarily switched to appropriate values when adding/removing files in archive through the archive browser
Improved displaying directory size in archive creation screen: items are now recursively enumerated asynchronously (non blocking) by default, so it is possible to proceed with archiving operations (confirm, cancel, modify parameters...) without needing the input count to be completed
Enumeration is skipped to save time in any case when sending directly input to archive, i.e. a script (or a menu entry) with -add2zip parameter
Now also "Enumerate folder content" menu entry action is performed asynchronously, not blocking the GUI while counting items
Enumeration can be set as usual from archiving screen, Advanced tab
Re-organized Archive manager settings page in Options > Settings
This page can now be also directly reached from Advanced tab in archiving and extraction screens, from "Set archive manager options" link
Archiving and extraction screens now focus more on options related to the current task and which may be frequently needed to be changed, while options related to the behavior of the application (expected to be usually set once and permanently) have been moved to Archive manager page in Settings
For Zpaq format now "Absolute paths" extraction option is enabled by default (in Advanced tab of extraction screen)

Various fixes

FILE MANAGER
Improved theming
New "Main" theme (default), with icons meant to visually integrate the application with most of the design styles found on supported platforms
New "Different" theme meant to integrate with macOS visual style without being too unfamiliar to users of modern Windows and Linux systems
New "Gray" theme meant to integrate with modern Windows systems and Fluent design
Previous versions theme is named "Ten" and can be set from the themes picker in Options > Settings, Theme tab, Advanced section
Other old themes are available collected in a separate package
Themes picker control was simplified
New .ico and .png icons are now available in (peazip)/res/share/icons directory for customizing the application on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems
Simplified organization of UI layout
New Style popup menu from the right of tool bar unifies the multiple submenus for quick customization of the UI
Righclicking on the Styles button is a secondary way to show column's header menu for organizing the browser in details mode (as column headers are not correctly handled on some target operating systems)
Status bar is now simpler and more focused on displaying information about navigation and password, now that styles-related controls are moved to the new Styles button in tool bar
On the left of the status bar displayed and selected items are shown, plus information about items cut or copied in the clipboard
Clicking or passing the mouse on that area displays comprehensive information about current archive (if applicable), filesystem and clipboard content
On the right of the status bar is available the button to enter / change password
Navigation submenu in context menu is now simpler and more focused on file browsing, with the removal of duplicate sytles-related controls
Unified navigation menu for address bar, breadcrumb and treeview to provide an single, easier to understand structure (organized in the same way of the navigation side bar), and to remove duplicate controls
Added session history popup menu to "back" and "forward" buttons, and breadcrumb popup menu to "up" button

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Added "Immediate execution" option for Profiles and Presets, in Add button's dropdown menu
If the option is flagged, custom compression profiles and presets immediately starts compression when selected without requiring confirmation
Added command line switches to compress items using one of the compression presets or loading a saved custom compression setting
-add2preset N uses Nth preset settings; presets are numbered from 0 to 15, and are fully customizable, they can be found in (peazip)/res/share/presets directory
-add2custom (full qualified name of the custom compression setting) uses the custom compression setting specified after the switch
Those switches can also be used in scripts (.reg, desktop files, .workflow service menus) employed to integrate PeaZip with Linux, Mac, and Windows systems
If "immediate execution" option is enabled, compression will start immediately without requiring confirmation, otherwise it will be possible to modify the task further before lanuching it
Added option to not immediately save edited files into archive, keeping changes for further editing (or for manually saving to archive from context menu, More submenu)
Labels in status bar of Archiving and Extraction screens are clickable to show synthetic information about the task

Updated compression defaults for LZMA, LZMA2/XZ, and PPMd accordingly to new 7z defaults
Updated compression presets in (peazip)/res/share/presets
Fixed: it is now possible to change compression level and algorithm using keyboard
Improved usage of Layouts
From main menu Tools > Apply filters to archive browser, it is possible to apply or to ignore (default) advanced filters for the archive browser, in this way the user can specify filters (i.e. file extensions) to be applied to archiving and extraction tasks without changing the way the file manager works
From main menu Options > Settings, Archive manager tab it is now possible to set a Layout to be opened automatically when starting PeaZip
Layouts can be now loaded and saved from the file manager (saving a Layout from file manager saves only Advanced filters as no input list is provided)
Improved scripting
Interactive extraction option is now ignored when creating scripts, which would otherwise point to a temporary work path rather than the intended output destination
This behavior can be changed in the configuration file editing [ignore interactive extraction option when creating scripts from Console tab] variable
Force UTF8 flag for file names ZIP archives is now enabeld by default, in order to better handling international characters on multiple platforms
Reversed a change introduced in previous version: 7z temporary work files during compression are no longer created inside peazip-tmp subpath, because it is created on the fly by PeaZip and would not function if the action is exported as script to be used separately

INSTALLERS
(macOS)
Moved (peazip)/res/bin directory to correct location into peazip.app/Contents/MacOS/ path

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
New option to not stop sequences of archive test tasks unless an error is encountered
From main menu, Options > Settings, Advanced tab set "Stop to inspect report for error, list" instead of default value "Stop to inspect report for error, list, test"
With this setting, a successful archive test closes on completion unless an error is foud in the archive and test fails, in which case error message (and full report) is shown to user and needs to be dismissed before continuing with following test in sequence
Improved management of temporary work files
7z/p7zip work files during compression are now inside peazip-tmp subpath, if work directory is set to Custom or User's temp

(Linux) szcnick/p7zip regressed from 17.04 to 17.02 due a possible bug handling some zip files
different versions / branches of p7zip (provided same syntax is employed) can be used simply replacing binaries in (peazip)res/bin/7z path
Updated to pea 1.04
To improve portability of PeaZip to multiple operating systems and architectures, app's folder is now structured as follows:
Application's root folder contains pea and peazip binaries (and dragdropfiles.dll on Windows), architecture-specific, compiled from src package
/res directory, contains resources divided by type
/res/portable (empty) file, marks the package as portable: if missing, the application woks as installable package and rearches for configuration in user's path (depending on the host system)
/res/bin directory contains third party architecture specific binaries, should be replaced with binaries for the apporpriate target architecture; on Windows it also contains PeaZip configuration wizard executabòe
/res/share directory contains non architecture specific resources such as texts, media, licenses, documentation (license and notes about binaries has been moved here in note subdiorectory), it could be simply copied as is for any PeaZip package on any system
/res/conf directory contains user specific configuration files
On installable packages res/conf is written to appropriate user specific path, and installers take care to replace /res/bin and /res/share with links to directories placed in appropriate paths depending on the target system

CODE
(Linux) Improved compliance with Open Desktop specifications: configuration is now saved in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/peazip directory; if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not defined configuration is saved to $HOME/.config/peazip

Improved theming
Added Color temperature option, to adapt application to DE using warmer or colder colors
Added Highlight tabs option (default on) highlighting rows or columns containing tabs with alternate color
Options > Settings > General, Privacy / Reset group, Working directory is now set to system's temp by default (consistently with most applications of this type)
Working directory label can now be clicked to explore path (unless it is set to output, which is variable), in order to make easier for the user to verify if for any reasons there are left orphaned files
All PeaZip's temporary work files and dirs are now collected in peazip-tmp subdirectory of work path (unless it is set to output) for same reason of making easier to spot and remove orphaned files
All PeaZip's temporary work files and dirs now contains p*tmp string for making easier to find them regardless the tools employed
Options > Settings > General, Privacy / Reset group now allows to silently skip deletion of locked temporary work files (default on, consistently with behavior of most applications of this type); temp work files can then be optionally deleted separately:
Automatically from Reset link, and if reset fails the folder is opened for soliciting manual deletion (regardless the option to silently skip locked files during normal operations)
Manually clicking on Working directory label and using standard system's tools
Options > Settings > File manager now allows to set the multiple-byte unit: binary, 1024 (IEC kibibyte), or decimal, 1000 (IEC kilobyte), or none (exact byte size)
Options > Settings > File manager now allows to customize the list of preferred algorithms for calculating file checksum and hashes; all preferred algorithms in the list will be performed in a single step when it is required to checksum / hash files.

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING

About screen now displays information about widget set and CPU architecture of the build for better troubleshooting
Improved command line usage
New res\batch\ folder containing sample scripts pointing to main app functions to help portabilize and deploy the application on multiple environments: the directory contains sample .bat scripts (Windows), SendTo menu links (Windows), freedesktop_integration examples (Linux) and will expand in future.
Fixed -add27z, -add2zip and related switches: when multiple items are passed the archive is named accordingly the directory name of first item, as in the GUI version of the same action
New -ext2here, -ext2folder (alias -ext2smart), -ext2newfolder switches for CL, executing single or multiple tasks as a single sequence of extract here, extract here smart folder, and extract here to new folder respectively
Extraction to new folder can now be forced to use smart folder option (-ext2folder, alias -ext2smart) or to not use it (-ext2newfolder)
With new extraction functions extraction of multiple items can run in a single instance without stealing the focus each time the next task in sequence is started
SendTo links to extraction functions are updated to use those new functions for better handling of queues of multiple tasks, now matching features provided by context menu entries but with advantages of being cross platform, not suffering artificial limitation of input items number, and being much more faster and cpu/memory efficient in receiving input list from system to application
Previous version of same switches, not running as a single instance queue, are available with "_" suffix, i.e. -ext2here_; in this way existing scripts does not need to be updated to benefit of new functions, but can be easily adapted to use old version of the switches if preferred
Improved generation of more compact command lines from GUI, with better detection of cases of automatic switch to "extract all"
Various fixes
Fixed breadcrumb for "Open unit as archive" in context menu, File manager > System tools
Fixed deselecting "TAR before" and selecting "Add each object to a separate archive" it is now possible to create multiple archive at once for types such as bz2, br, gz, zst

The new columns can be enabled/disabled from columns header's context menu, and from main menu > Organize > Browser > Columns; if enabled, those columns are automatically shown browsing archives and hidden browsing the fileystem
Folders in 7z/p7zip archives now show number of contained folders, files, and total uncompressed size (displayed in same column of files' checksums)
This feature is limited on basis of the number of items contained in the archive, and can be tuned from "Browser optimization" dropdown menu in Options > Settings, General tab Performances group
New Ctrl+Alt+A link to autoadjust file browser columns
Themes: added "Presets" link on the right of Application accent color picker, allowing to quickly customize both application and text accent colors accordingly to common color themes of reference Operating Systems e.g. Mint, Ubuntu, Windows

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Added XZ (Linux, Windows) and Zstd (Linux) as optional algorithms for ZIP/ZIPX compression, from Advanced tab in archiving / conversion screen
Improved extraction
Added option to skip testing for encryption on extraction, suppressing password requests
Improved Interactive extraction option
Empty folder is now removed in case of error with Extract to new folder
Naming policy dropdown menu is enabled with "Interactive extraction", allowing to resolve issues of conflicting filenames in the same archive
New "Keep files" link in extraction progress windows in case of errors "Interactive extraction", allows to preserve extracted files which would be otherwise automatically deleted
New "Store all timestamps" option (checked by default) is available in Archiving / Conversion screen
If this option is active, created, modified, last access time are saved to archive rather than modified timestamp only; formats supporting this feature are: 7Z, RAR, ZIP
Improved raw file spanning, it is now possible to submit multiple separate input files at once to be split to specified size
Improved support for .xxxaa spanned files from Unix/Linux split command
New option for default behavior at application startup: Extract all here (smart new folder)
This option can be set from Options > Settings > Archive manager
Doubleclicking on an a file of associated type, or clicking Open from context menu on a group of selected files associated with PeaZip, the selected action is performed
Available actions: Open (default), Open as archive (force trying to open file as archive), Extract (showing options and confirmation screen), Extract all here, Extract all here (smart new folder)

WINDOWS & LINUX INSTALLERS
(Windows) SendTo menu entries use new extraction functions, more efficient for handling queues of multiple tasks, and "Extract here (smart new folder)" replaces "Extract here (in new folder)"
With this update SendTo functions provides same features provided by context menu entries, but much more faster and efficient and without artificial limitation in terms of number of input items
(Linux) Improved Linux installers
install the app in /opt/peazip directory (non capitalized)
configuration files are saved in .PeaZip directory in user's home as in previous releases
link peazip binary in /usr/bin
place peazip.desktop file in /usr/share/applications

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Added "Force typing passwords interactively" option in password screen that forces to always type password in the native backend interface
This option allows to create scripts that will require operator to enter the password interactively rather than running unattended
Zpaq backend does not support this option
Backends not supporting encryption are not affected by this option
Please note this option forces console mode for backend utilities (except PEA, which is a graphic application)
With this option enabled PeaZip cannot browse archives with encrypted name of files (encrypted toc), but it is anyway possible to list/test/extract them
Can now edit existing 7Z-compressed sfx archives
Improved "TAR before" option, which saves multiple input to TAR archive before compression step

Open, default
Open as archive, force trying to open any arbitrary file type as archive
Extract..., show full extraction screen to enter password and change options before confirming extraction
