Pea 1.00
Added 512 bit hash functions to PeaUtils menu, also available from Windows context menu (CRC, hash entry): Blake2b, SHA512, SHA3_512, Whirlpool

CODE
Various fixes

FILE MANAGER
Improved theming: new customizable parameters - beyond standard scaling which follows system's metric - can be set at runtime, and saved into themes, to improve usability for visually impaired users, small / far screens, or touch devices
Spacing [small, medium, large] to increase spacing in file manager and row height in tables
Zooming [100% to 150%] to enlarge icons and graphic elements
(Windows) Quick delete function can now delete files requiring UAC elevation
Working directory is now set to by default to: user tmp for preview operations, output for other operations
"Extract everything for" preview for special file types now uses working directory (as standard preview mode)
"Interactive extraction" now uses working directory; disallowing temporary work files results in disabling interactive extraction, falling back to standard extraction mode

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
(Linux) Improved interactive extraction, which is now set on by default in extraction screen
If no naming conflict is detected, the output data is now moved, if possible, rather than copied to the intended destination, which is extremely faster
(Windows XP, ReactOS) Fixed handling non supported additional 7Z codecs
(Windows) "TAR before" action now correctly asks for UAC elevation if needed
Improved support for ZPAQ format
Fixed test of ZPAQ format from context menu
ZPAQ format extraction, without checking "Absoulte paths", removes extra nesting levels from the output
In case multiple revisions are featured, the nesting (which starts from the root of the archive) is preserved
Main window is now hidden during list, test, and ctrl+c/ctrl+v extraction operations, in order to reduce visual clutter accordingly with behavior during archive, and extract operations

WINDOWS & LINUX INSTALLERS
(Linux) Qt5 build available pre-packed as DEB and RPM, alongside portable version not requiring installation

(Linux) Alternative Qt5 build is now available as portable package
If a setting requires to restart PeaZip (localization, system integration, change work folder) it is told in the hint text for the item
Various fixes and improvements

FILE MANAGER
(Windows) Drag&drop now allows to drag-extract files directly to other applications, previoulsy it was possible to drag-extract to the system only - 2021 03 22 fix for Windows 32 bit version, sources and legacy Windows 32 bit packages were republished and online hash values were updated
Righclicking an element on the breadcrumb it is now possible to use context menu functions on it - e.g. display properties, open the path in system's file explorer, open command prompt here, etc

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Interactive extraction option (checked by default on Windows) enables two-step extraction for all archive types supported through 7z/p7zip: content is extracted to a fresh folder and then moved to actual output destination with standard system's calls.
When interactive extraction is used, all unneeded levels of directory nesting are removed, and conflicts with existing files are prompted interactively to user.
Unchecking the option, it is possible to perform single-step extraction as in previous versions, with policy based directives to resolve naming conflicts without needing user interaction (recommended when creating scripts).
It is now possible to set custom extensions for "Extract everything for" in Options > Settings > Archive manager, Extract group
It is now possible to replace archive extension with a custom extension from archiving screen, Advanced tab
In res/presets/custom directory are provided some pre built compression settings for comic book archive formats which uses the new custom extension feature
Priority for archiving and extraction tasks can now be permanently set from Options > Settings > General, Tasks priority
(Windows 7+) Global progress is shown in application's icon in taskbar

7.7.1
BACKEND 
Pea 0.76
UPX was removed from Windows packages due the amount of false positives triggered in (low quality) security software; it is possible to add UPX support installing Additional Formats Plugin, or downloading and copying the most up to date UPX executable in res\upx subfolder in PeaZip's directory

CODE
Command line -ext2simple and -ext2simplefolder can now accept also empthy output path (extract to archive's path)
-ext2simplefolder as -ext2folder (switch -*folder) apply smart folder policy, while -ext2simple and -ext2here ignores it
Updated web search (Ctrl+Alt+F3)
Updated Windows installers to work with recent versions of InnoSetup (.exe) and MSIWrapper (.msi)

requires p7zip-full (or equivalent package) to be installed in order to have a 7z binary compatible with PeaZip's requirements in terms of syntax and features

CODE
Various fixes

FILE MANAGER
Added shortcut Ctrl+W to close window, consistently with conventional use in WinRar and Windows file explorer
Improved control over temporary work directory, used when the archive is created or edited, during drag and drop extraction (Windows), and content preview
Output: faster as no copy to destination is needed, more secure as no content is unpacked/decrypted outside of the intended destination path
Output, preview in user's temp
User's temp (as conventionally used by most applications): in case of failure for any reason, user's temp folder is the single place to look for orphaned data and can be safely cleaned
None, user's temp if needed: allows exceptions to perform drag and drop extraction and preview using user's temp
None: no exceptions allowed, no temporary work data is saved, this does not allow to perform neither drag and drop extraction nor preview, as archive content can't be transparently unpacked and passed to system's drag & drop handler, nor to the associated application

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Added read support to .appxbundle format

2020 12 15
7.6.0
BACKEND
(Winodws, ReactOS) McMilk codecs in 7z\Codecs path are now automatically checked at PeaZip startup, in order to disable them (moving in 7z\Codecs\bk) on systems not capable to run them (as XP or ReactOS), and re-enable them on other systems; this works for both Portable and installable packages without requiring manual intervention

Local code page, then UTF-8 for sysmbols outside local code page (default)
Force UTF-8 for non-ASCII characters
Force local code page
Use a custom code page: an arbitrary code page can be entered by user (the host machine needs to support the code page to run the tasks, otherwise tasks can be saved as scripts and run on different machines)
Text encoding entry is now accessible also from application's file browser context menu, and in Archiving and Extraction screens context menus
Within PeaZip file manager it is now possible to use copy/paste shortcuts Ctrl+C (or Ctrl+X) / Ctrl+V to extract items from archives to filesystem
If clipboard is set to keep multiple selection operations at once:
Copy/paste extraction is possible form multiple archives at once
It is also possibile to mix cut/paste and extraction operations
Extraction targets the file system, it is not currently possible i.e. to directly paste compressed items from archive A to archive B

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Added "Extract everything for special file types" (to 7Z-supported archive types) to optionally extract the entire archive (or current path) to preview special filetypes which usually needs external data to properly run, in example .html, .bat, and .exe files
From Options > Settings > Archive manager, Extract group is possible to customize "Extract everything for..." behavior
Never use special preview, Ask, Always (default)
Extract entire archive (default) or Extract displayed items only (items in current path, or matching search filters) which can be faster than extracting the entire archive
Archive timestamp preservation directive is now also applied to rename and delete operations (previously only for add / update)
Options > Settings > Archive manager, Extract group: added option to auto close PeaZip after extraction if no browsing actions took place (default off), useful in example if a downloaded file was opened for quick inspection before extraction
Options > Settings > General (Windows): added options for locking or hiding target window during drag and drop operations, by default target window is hidden and locked while the operation is running
Out of the box default compression levels are set to fast for ZIP and 7Z formats
compared to previous ZIP normal default, ZIP fast is over 400% faster providing 2% worse compression ratio, and 7Z fast is 25% faster providing 3% better compression ratio
compared to previous 7Z normal default, 7Z fast is 500% faster providing 5% worse compression ratio
please note compression levels and compression presets works as usual, the new settings are meant only to provide novice users better performance balance for general purpose tasks

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
[Prototype] Support for RAR compression if WinRar 64 or 32 bit is installed in the system (Windows)
Setting Custom compression type optionally aut-configures PeaZip to use RarLab's Rar.exe as compressor; if libre_directive option is set to 2 (most restrictive, not allowing closed archive formats), rar creation will be not allowed in any case
Rar.exe will be set to use PeaZip's work dir as other backend binaries
For RAR archives it is possible to set
compression level, from store to maximum
action: new archive, add, update, freshen, sync with disk
spanning in multiple volumes
password, optionally with two factor authentication (password + keyfile)
create RAR5 or legacy RAR4 archive
(RAR5) set dictionary size 1..1024 MB
(RAR5) use BLAKE2 hash instead of CRC checksum
Create self extracting RAR
Solid archive
Recovery records
Save files open for writing
Save NT security information
Save NTFS streams

PEA 0.70
(Linux) UPX 3.96
Please note: updating UPX in Windows packages triggered false positives from multiple antimalware, consequently the update was removed from Windows packages restoring UPX 3.95.
This is not, in any way, a fault of UPX, which is and remains a legitimate and safe software, but being one of the tools that may be employed by malware to compress binary payload, it is regarded as higly suspicious by most anytivirus, and in the past it triggered several false positives for PeaZip for Windows, almost at each update, taking months to be corrected from antivirus teams - and some of false positives are not yet fixed after years, nor the feedback mails were ever answered.
For the future I'll consider about introducing UPX support as a separate plugin, so it can be stripped from main package, and manually updated by end user, to keep it up to date e.g. in the case security issues surfaces on older UPX versions.
If you want to use last version of UPX on PeaZip for Windows, please replace the executable manually, until same syntax is honored the executable can be freely replaced.

Option is on by default, can be set in Options > Settings > Archive manager
Drag & drop can now be hot swapped between standard and custom mode while using the application
Improved finding duplicate files, both with crc/hash and quick duplicate check: Info column shows "D" for duplicate for each copy of file with same digest value, except the last copy found
Sorting files for Info column allows to quickly select (and delete) duplicate items
Sorting files for checksum/hash column allows to easily compare identical files as in previous versions
New function to analyze content of folders in file browser (from column header menu)
Info column marks empty folders with "E"
Checksum/hash column shows content of folders: number of directories, number of files, and total size
New scaling mechanism for better support of high DPI in PeaZip and Pea executables
UI elements are scaled at run time at discrete steps zooming up to 10x of design time size, using Lazaruz LCL scaling
Graphic is accordingly scaled at run time, accepting arbitrarily sized graphic sources
Embedded 16 and 32 pixel icons are currently provided with 3x definition (48 and 96 pixel respectively) to provide high quality graphic up to 300% scaling
New themes for PeaZip version 7+ uses 8 or 32 bit PNG with transparency, and currently provides 16 and 32 pixel icons upscaled to 3x definition
New Windows icons for menus and file types; new icons allows to better distinguish supported file types, at large and small resolutions
When a single file of unsupported format is passed as parameter, the application lets the user decide if to try to open it as archive or to add it to new archive

EXTRACTION and ARCHIVING
Improved progress bar accuracy
Option to delete input files after task completion is now globally applied to all archiving / extraction functions
