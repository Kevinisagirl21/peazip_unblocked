3.9.1
BACKEND
Fewer FreeArc's SFX modules are now embedded by default: arc-tiny.linux.sfx, freearc.sfx, freearc-installer.sfx, freearc-tiny.sfx. If needed, other self extracting modules can still be downloaded from FreeArc's official website for free.
Main executables are no longer compressed with UPX, resulting in a bit larger disk occupation (about 7MB) but smaller installer (about 1.5 MB) and less RAM usage (each instance does no longer need to be uncompressed in memory to run)
If it is critical to reduce disk occupation, executables can be compressed with UPX through PeaZip itself

2011 02 26
3.6.2
FILE MANAGER
(recommended) Improved recognition of malformed archives not explicitly listing folders' entries, now PeaZip is able to auto-switch to Flat view in order to show the full content of those archives in all tested cases

3.6
BACKEND
Updated to Pea 0.34

CODE
Updated Wolfgang Ehrhardt's crypto lybrary with crc_hash_2010-12-19

FILE MANAGER
Fixed: installable version unable to update archives on Windows 64 bit
default 7z working dir (-w parameter) changed to explicitly set to use output path
if 7z working dir is set to temporary folder, let 7z determinate the appropriate path
when deleting files from a file supported through 7z backend, apply 7z working dir preference
Fixed button position and size with large fonts / high dpi
StringGrid's rows are now auto sized
Modal buttons text is now translated
Open output path moved from Options to Add and Extract interfaces for better visibility
On archive creation, if password is set and the format supports encryption, the encryption label is evidenced in green for better visibility
New option for ignoring paths for drag and drop extraction (default on)
with ignore path directive applied, extraction through 7z and freearc backends will be performed using e (extract without paths) instead of x (extract with paths), in order to extract files from the archive without recreating the parent path's directory tree on the extraction destination
with this new directive applied by default, all partial extraction operations starting from the file/archive browser (extract and open, and extraction by drag and drop), behaves uniformly trying to extract selected file(s) without recreating parent path tree
the directive is overridden if a directory is selected, as extraction without paths will lose information about directory tree below that directory
see Options > Settings, Open archive tab for fine tuning "ignore paths" directives

129 file extensions supported
Added support for .APK (Android package) and .SAR, and .IMF (IncrediMail)

new quick extraction menu and keyboard shortcut Ctrl+0 to extract to same path of last successfull extraction operation
reorganized info mode for status bar (Ctrl+Alt+2)

to prevent loss of time and user's focus a fresh instance of PeaZip is started in the last directory while the old instance is handled in background
Added PanelIntro, usually not visible due to the speed of a normal startup
if startup of the program is slowed for any reason user is informed about loading progress (0 inital form status 1 configuration and theming files loaded 2 input parameters parsed and executed)
controls cannot be clicked for error until GUI is fully loaded and ready to accept user's input
some controls load faster as they aren't visible

Rationalized themes moving some common decoration elements from separate bitmaps to non-themed graphic resources of the executable
Various minor fixes and improvements
124 file extensions supported
