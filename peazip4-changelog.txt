as encrypted file, for backup
a password list's .bak file can be manually imported back as password manager file, renaming it as pm (no extension) and copying it to PeaZip's configuration path (linked in Options > Settings); this file will have the same content and password it had when it was originally saved. This mechanism in example allows to roll back to a previous password list, or maintain various off line password lists, or exchange protected password lists with other users or other machines

FILE MANAGER
(Windows) File manager shows image thumbnails and information about graphic files, only while browsing/searching the filesystem
thumbnails does not get stored
thumbnails calculation generates a set of 4 dedicated threads, if folder or search filter is changed a new set of threads is created and old threads are stopped as soon as possible (file level and thread level granularity: each thread can be stopped separately, at the completition of each image)
Organize > Show picture thumbnails in main menu toggle the feature on/off
No file is selected when an archive is opened (generally, anytime listing root level of the archive), so by default extract button performs "extract all"
